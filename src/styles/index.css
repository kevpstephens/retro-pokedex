/* ":root" -> this is a CSS pseudo-class that targets the highest-level element in the DOM, which is always the <html> tag.

/* "#root" -> This is a CSS ID selector, targeting the element with the ID root — which, in a React app, is the <div id="root"></div> in your index.html.

•	This specifically styles the React mounting point, i.e., the wrapper for everything your React app renders.
•	You often use this to set max-width, centering, or layout rules for your entire app. */
