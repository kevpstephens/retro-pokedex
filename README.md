# 📚 React Mini App Template – Dictionary App

This project is a clean, minimal React starter app designed for small, focused React projects. It's built using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast development, and demonstrates:

- Component-based architecture
- Controlled components
- Basic state management
- Form handling with submit behavior
- Simple styling
- Static JSON data usage

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Create the project:**
   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest
   # Choose: React, JavaScript
   cd your-app-name
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## 🧹 Cleanup Steps After Vite Init

- Delete demo assets: `src/assets`, `vite.svg`, and related imports
- Remove demo JSX from `App.jsx` (logos, counter, etc.)
- Keep `App.css` for your custom styles
- Update `<title>` in `index.html` if desired

## 📁 Project Structure

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── SearchForm.jsx
│   └── DisplayWord.jsx
├── data/
│   └── dictionary.json
├── App.jsx
├── App.css
├── index.css
├── main.jsx
```

- `SearchForm.jsx`: Controlled input with form submission logic.
- `DisplayWord.jsx`: Shows the result of the dictionary search.
- `dictionary.json`: Static object of words and definitions.

---

## 🎨 Styling

Basic layout and element styles are included in `App.css` using a structured approach:

- Reset + base styles
- Layout containers (`.app-container`, `#root`)
- Typography and structural styling
- Input and button formatting

You can enhance it with your own color themes, utility classes, or frameworks like Tailwind.

---

## 🛠 Customization

To reuse this template for another mini app:

1. Replace or extend `dictionary.json` (or swap it for API calls).
2. Change the input field and output display as needed.
3. Modify or add components inside `src/components/`.
